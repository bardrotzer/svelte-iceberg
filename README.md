# A 3D iceberg

An attempt to create a working 3D iceberg model in a svelte app. Just trying out different things.

## what trying out?
Well, I've never done web 3D before, so Im just trying out using `three.js` and wrapping it in a self contained svelte app.

## running / setup
Using `yarn` and `rollup` for this, but use what suits you.

```bash
 # install dependencies
 yarn install
 # run and play
 yarn serve

```

## stack

* [tree.js](https://threejs.org/) - for the 3D
* [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - for the app
